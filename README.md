**Course Work – Audio Signal Processing & Analysis** /n
This project contains Python-based coursework focused on audio signal analysis and visualization. It includes code to process .wav audio files, perform transformations such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), apply filtering techniques, and visualize waveforms using plots. Interactive audio playback is also supported for exploring sound characteristics.


🔍 Features:
📈 - Waveform Visualization: Plot time-domain representations of audio signals.

⚙️ - FFT Analysis: Convert signals to the frequency domain using FFT and visualize spectral content.

🎚️ - Filtering: Apply signal processing filters to isolate or remove frequencies.

🔁 - Inverse Transforms: Reconstruct time-domain signals from processed frequency data.

🔊 - Audio Playback: Play audio within a Jupyter Notebook for inspection and comparison.

📁 - Contents
Python code cells: For reading, transforming, and visualizing audio data.

Plots: Time-domain and frequency-domain visualizations.

WAV file handling: Reading audio files and converting them into arrays for analysis.

Signal transformations: Including FFT, iFFT, and basic filtering with scipy.signal.

Notebook export: Provided as an .html file for easy sharing or viewing outside of Jupyter.
